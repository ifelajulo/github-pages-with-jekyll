Kager says that working with code has direct, tangible rewards you can’t find in every field—namely the fact that coders are responding with product features and fixes based on the needs and wants of real people using their websites or software. In particular for Kager, working with open source software brings a special kind of pride. “Since our code is open source,” Kager says, “anyone can go look at how I solved a problem they might be having in their own app. It makes me feel like I’m contributing to universal knowledge, which is an amazing feeling.”

Melnyk shares the sentiment that coding offers gratifying rewards unique to the profession. “I love the instant satisfaction of seeing what you’ve built show up on a webpage and being able to know immediately whether it’s working or not.” Melnyk says. Additionally, Melnyk cites the challenges that come up during coding as big part of what makes it not only not boring, but actively engaging—things will go wrong with code, that’s a given, but learning from those challenges is what elevates code from any surface perceptions of being dull.

Melnyk says she realized how much she loved coding while she was learning to code in a Computer Systems Technology class. She and other students were building websites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP and Melnyk wasn’t working on her usual computer. After finishing about 70 percent of her work, she finished for the day, but when she came back and returned to the computer she normally used she couldn’t find any of the work she’d completed. “I figured none of it saved and I started over—this time until I was done building the site,” Melnyk says. “After I finished, though, I realized I hadn’t actually lost any of my prior work—I’d just saved it to the other computer’s hard drive instead of my roaming profile.” But, Melnyk says, she was surprised to find that she didn’t even care about having to do so much extra work. “I got so much hands-on knowledge through redoing the project and I loved every minute of it,” Melnyk says. “Getting to do it twice really helped me understand what I was doing and made me push myself that much harder.”
